# Azhagu Resume

This repository, `azhagu-swe-resume.git`, contains my professional resume built using LaTeX. The resume is designed to showcase skills, experience, and projects in a concise and visually appealing format.

## Features

- **Clean and Modern Design**: Utilizes a custom LaTeX class (`azhagu-swe-resume-openfont.cls`) for a structured and aesthetic layout.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to adapt the design and structure for your personal use.
- **Customizable**: Easy to update information such as education, skills, and projects.

## Files in this Repository

- `resume.tex`: The main LaTeX file containing the resume content.
- `azhagu-swe-resume-openfont.cls`: The custom class file for the resume template.
- `fonts/`: Folder containing the required fonts (`Lato` and `Raleway`).
- `publications.bib`: BibTeX file for managing the publications section (if applicable).

- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX).
